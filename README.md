# Java-OOP-SoftUni
The Java OOP course will teach learners the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. Students will go into the most frequently used design patterns. Attention will be paid to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD), the use of reflection.
